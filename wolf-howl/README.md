# 🐺🌙 HOWL — Hunt, Optimize, Win, Learn

The WOLF hunts all day. At night, it HOWLs — reviewing every trade, finding patterns, and sharpening itself for tomorrow.

Automated nightly self-improvement loop for the [WOLF strategy](../wolf-strategy/SKILL.md). A sub-agent analyzes every trade from the last 24 hours and produces data-driven improvement suggestions.

## What It Does

Every night at 23:55 (configurable), an isolated sub-agent:

1. **Gathers** — reads trade history, DSL state files, memory logs, scanner output
2. **Analyzes** — per-trade breakdown: entry signal quality, DSL tier reached, close trigger, PnL
3. **Computes** — win rate, profit factor, signal quality correlation, slot utilization, dead weight duration
4. **Identifies** — patterns distinguishing winners from losers, DSL calibration, missed opportunities
5. **Reports** — structured report saved to `memory/howl-YYYY-MM-DD.md` + Telegram summary
6. **Learns** — appends distilled insights to `MEMORY.md` for long-term strategy improvement

## What's Included
