# Senpi Skill Development Guide

Best practices for building production-quality Senpi skills. Extracted from battle-tested patterns in WOLF v6, Emerging Movers, Opportunity Scanner, and other skills.

This guide is for **agents and developers** creating new skills.

## 2. Token Optimization

Token burn is the single biggest operational cost. These patterns reduce it dramatically.

### 2.1 Model Tiering

**2-tier (Mid/Budget) is the default.** Most crons are self-contained — the script output provides all context the LLM needs. Primary tier (main session) is rarely required.

| Tier | Use When | Session Type | Example Model IDs |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Mid** | Structured tasks, script output parsing, rule-based actions, routing decisions | Isolated | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `openai/gpt-4o`, `google/gemini-2.0-flash` |
| **Budget** | Simple threshold checks, binary decisions, heartbeat-heavy crons | Isolated | `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`, `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite` |

**Before reaching for Primary tier**, ask: does this cron genuinely need cross-run accumulated context (e.g., remembering routing decisions from previous runs)? If the script can include all necessary context in its JSON output — strategy slots, positions, routing state — the cron can run on Mid tier in an isolated session.

**Primary tier** (main session) is available when truly needed:

| Tier | Use When | Session Type |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Primary** | Cross-run context is essential — the LLM must remember state from previous cron executions | Main |

Even complex routing crons can work on Mid tier when scripts surface complete context (available slots, current positions, routing history) in their JSON output. Only promote to Primary when the decision depends on conversational memory that no script can provide.

Document the tier and session type for each cron in your `cron-templates.md`.

### 2.2 Heartbeat Early Exit

If a cron run finds nothing actionable, output `HEARTBEAT_OK` immediately. Do not enumerate what was checked.

```
# BAD — wastes tokens on narrative
"Checked 50 markets. No signals above threshold. BTC is flat. Funding rates normal. Nothing to do."

# GOOD — immediate exit
"HEARTBEAT_OK"
```

### 2.3 Minimal Default Output

Scripts should return only the fields the LLM needs for its decision. Diagnostic detail should be opt-in.

```python
# Default: minimal
output = {
    "asset": "HYPE", "direction": "LONG",
    "score": 185, "risks": ["high_funding"]
}

# Verbose (opt-in via env var):
if os.environ.get("MY_SKILL_VERBOSE") == "1":
    output["debug"] = { "all_pillar_scores": {...}, "candle_data": {...} }
```

**Specific techniques:**
- Remove `indent=2` from `json.dumps()` — whitespace costs tokens on large outputs
- Drop informational fields that don't affect the decision
- Below-threshold items: output only `asset` + `score`, not the full analysis
- Remove duplicate data structures (e.g., a separate `closed` array when `status=="closed"` already exists in `results`)

### 2.4 Prompt Compression

Move detailed rules into `SKILL.md` (loaded once into agent context). Cron templates should reference them with one-liners.

```
# BAD — 26-line cron mandate repeating all entry rules
"Check if rank jumped 10+, verify not in top 10, check hourly trend, verify leverage >= 7x,
check slot availability, check rotation cooldown, verify no existing position..."

# GOOD — 4-line cron mandate referencing SKILL.md
"Run `python3 scripts/emerging-movers.py`, parse JSON.
On signals: apply entry rules from SKILL.md, route to best-fit strategy.
Alert Telegram. Else HEARTBEAT_OK."
```

### 2.5 Processing Order Directives

Give crons explicit numbered steps to prevent the LLM from re-reading files or looping:

```
PROCESSING ORDER:
1. Read config ONCE. Map available slots.
2. Build complete action plan: [(asset, direction, margin), ...]
3. Execute entries sequentially. No re-reads.
4. Send ONE consolidated Telegram after all entries.
```

This prevents: config re-reads per action, multiple Telegram messages, context growth from repeated tool calls.

### 2.6 Context Isolation

**Within a cron run:**
- Read config files ONCE per cron run
- Build a complete action plan before executing any tool calls
- Send ONE consolidated notification per run, not one per signal
- Skip redundant checks when data is fresh (e.g., < 3 min old)

**Across cron runs — session isolation:**

Crons run in one of two session types:

| Session Type | When to Use | Behavior |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Main** (`sessionTarget: "main"`) | Cron needs accumulated context — routing history, position knowledge, multi-step judgment | Shares context with other main-session crons. Uses the agent's configured Primary model. |
| **Isolated** (`sessionTarget: "isolated"`) | Cron is self-contained — script output has everything the LLM needs to decide | Fresh session per run. No context pollution. Runs a cheaper Mid/Budget model specified in the payload. |

**Default to isolated.** Most crons are self-contained: run script → parse JSON → act or HEARTBEAT_OK. Only promote to main session when the cron genuinely needs cross-run context (e.g., remembering which strategies were routed to previously).

**Isolation decision checklist — before promoting any cron to main session, ask:**

1. Does this cron need to **remember something from a previous run** that the script cannot provide?
2. If the script output contains everything needed for the decision (positions, slots, routing context, state) → **isolated**.
3. Even entry/routing crons can be isolated when the script surfaces strategy slots, current positions, and routing context in its JSON output.
4. If the only reason for main session is "it's complex" — that's not sufficient. Complexity belongs in the script, not in accumulated LLM context.

**Why this matters:**
- Isolated crons don't pollute the main session's context window with repetitive heartbeats
- Cheaper models (Mid/Budget) run on isolated sessions, reducing cost
- Main session stays lean — only crons that need shared context contribute to it
- Isolated sessions prevent re-firing of informational warnings every cycle (no memory = no stale state)

## 3. Using Senpi MCP (mcporter)

### 3.1 Always Use MCP — Never Direct API Calls

All external data must go through Senpi MCP via `mcporter`. Never `curl` third-party APIs directly.

```python
# BAD — direct API call
r = subprocess.run(["curl", "-s", "-X", "POST", "https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/info",
    "-d", json.dumps({"type": "allMids"})], capture_output=True, text=True)

# GOOD — MCP call via centralized helper (see Section 3.2)
data = mcporter_call("market_get_prices")
prices = data.get("prices", {})
```

**Why MCP over direct APIs:**
- MCP handles auth, rate limiting, and caching
- Consistent error format across all tools
- Single abstraction layer — if the upstream API changes, only MCP needs updating
- No secrets (API keys, endpoints) in your skill code

### 3.2 Unified MCP Call Helper

Create **one** centralized helper in your shared config module (`{skill}_config.py`). All scripts import and use this — no script should invoke `mcporter` directly.

```python
import json, os, subprocess, time, tempfile, shlex

def mcporter_call(tool, retries=3, timeout=30, **kwargs):
    """Call a Senpi MCP tool via mcporter. Returns the `data` portion of the response.

    Args:
        tool: Tool name (e.g. "market_get_prices", "close_position").
        retries: Number of attempts before giving up.
        timeout: Subprocess timeout in seconds.
        **kwargs: Tool arguments as key=value pairs.

    Returns:
        The `data` dict from the MCP response envelope (envelope already stripped).

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If all retries fail or the tool returns success=false.
    """
    args = []
    for k, v in kwargs.items():
        if v is None:
            continue
        if isinstance(v, (list, dict, bool)):
            args.append(f"{k}={json.dumps(v)}")
        else:
            args.append(f"{k}={v}")

    mcporter_bin = os.environ.get("MCPORTER_CMD", "mcporter")
    cmd_str = " ".join(
        [shlex.quote(mcporter_bin), "call", shlex.quote(f"senpi.{tool}")]
        + [shlex.quote(a) for a in args]
    )
    last_error = None

    for attempt in range(retries):
        fd, tmp = None, None
        try:
            fd, tmp = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix=".json")
            os.close(fd)
            subprocess.run(
                f"{cmd_str} > {tmp} 2>/dev/null",
                shell=True, timeout=timeout,
            )
            with open(tmp) as f:
                d = json.load(f)
            if d.get("success"):
                return d.get("data", {})       # ← strip envelope here
            last_error = d.get("error", d)
        except (json.JSONDecodeError, subprocess.TimeoutExpired, OSError) as e:
            last_error = str(e)
        finally:
            if tmp and os.path.exists(tmp):
                os.unlink(tmp)
        if attempt < retries - 1:
            time.sleep(3)

    raise RuntimeError(f"mcporter {tool} failed after {retries} attempts: {last_error}")


def mcporter_call_safe(tool, retries=3, timeout=30, **kwargs):
    """Like mcporter_call but returns None instead of raising on failure."""
    try:
        return mcporter_call(tool, retries=retries, timeout=timeout, **kwargs)
    except RuntimeError:
        return None
```

**Key design decisions:**
- **Temp file, not `capture_output`** — mcporter output can exceed pipe buffer limits on large responses. Writing to a temp file avoids silent truncation.
- **`shlex.quote` on all args** — prevents shell injection even with `shell=True`.
- **Envelope stripped in one place** — callers never see `{success, data}`. They get the inner `data` dict directly.
- **Two variants** — `mcporter_call` raises on failure (for critical paths), `mcporter_call_safe` returns `None` (for best-effort fetches).
- **`tempfile.mkstemp` not `mktemp`** — `mktemp` is deprecated (race condition). `mkstemp` atomically creates the file.

### 3.3 Response Envelope Parsing

MCP responses are wrapped in a `{success, data}` envelope. The centralized helper strips it (see 3.2), so callers work directly with the inner data. But the inner data itself has tool-specific nesting that callers must handle.

```python
# The raw MCP response looks like:
# {"success": true, "data": {"prices": {"BTC": "65000", "ETH": "3500", ...}}}
#
# After mcporter_call strips the envelope, you get:
# {"prices": {"BTC": "65000", "ETH": "3500", ...}}
#
# Callers extract the specific field they need:
prices = data.get("prices", {})
```

**Common extraction patterns (after envelope is stripped):**

```python
# market_get_prices → nested under "prices"
data = mcporter_call("market_get_prices")
prices = data.get("prices", {})

# market_list_instruments → nested under "instruments"
data = mcporter_call("market_list_instruments")
instruments = data.get("instruments", [])

# leaderboard_get_markets → double-nested
data = mcporter_call("leaderboard_get_markets")
markets = data.get("markets", {}).get("markets", [])

# leaderboard_get_top → double-nested differently
data = mcporter_call("leaderboard_get_top", limit=100)
traders = data.get("leaderboard", {}).get("data", [])

# clearinghouse state → separate sections
data = mcporter_call("strategy_get_clearinghouse_state", strategy_wallet=wallet)
crypto = data.get("main", {})
xyz = data.get("xyz", {})
```

**The #1 bug pattern:** Forgetting to strip the envelope (doing `data["prices"]` on the raw response → `KeyError`) or double-stripping (adding `.get("data", raw)` when the helper already stripped it → missing data). Pick ONE place to strip the envelope and never strip it again.

### 3.4 Batch MCP Calls

Prefer single batched calls over multiple separate calls:

```python
# BAD — 3 separate API calls
candles_4h = call_mcp("market_get_candles", asset="BTC", timeframe="4h")
candles_1h = call_mcp("market_get_candles", asset="BTC", timeframe="1h")
candles_15m = call_mcp("market_get_candles", asset="BTC", timeframe="15m")

# GOOD — 1 call returning all intervals
data = call_mcp("market_get_asset_data",
    asset="BTC",
    candle_intervals=["4h", "1h", "15m"],
    include_order_book=False,
    include_funding=False)
```

### 3.5 Reduce Redundant API Calls

If a single API call returns data for multiple contexts, use it instead of making separate calls:

```python
# BAD — two separate calls for crypto and equities
crypto = mcporter_call("get_clearinghouse_state", wallet=w)
xyz = mcporter_call("get_clearinghouse_state", wallet=w, dex="xyz")

# GOOD — one call returns both sections
data = mcporter_call("get_clearinghouse_state", wallet=w)
crypto = data.get("main", {})
xyz = data.get("xyz", {})
```

When processing similar data from multiple sections, extract a shared helper:

```python
def _extract_positions(section_data):
    """Extract non-zero positions from a clearinghouse section."""
    positions = {}
    for p in section_data.get("assetPositions", []):
        pos = p.get("position", {})
        coin = pos.get("coin")
        szi = float(pos.get("szi", 0))
        if not coin or szi == 0:
            continue
        positions[coin] = {
            "direction": "SHORT" if szi < 0 else "LONG",
            "size": abs(szi),
            # ... other fields
        }
    return positions

# One helper, two calls — no duplicated parsing
crypto_positions = _extract_positions(data.get("main", {}))
xyz_positions = _extract_positions(data.get("xyz", {}))
```

### 3.6 Subprocess Safety

- **`shlex.quote()` all arguments** — when using `shell=True` for output redirection, quote every variable part of the command to prevent injection.
- **`tempfile.mkstemp` for temp files** — atomically creates a unique file. Always clean up in a `finally` block.
- **Always set `timeout`** — prevent hung processes: `timeout=15` for lightweight calls, `timeout=30` for data-heavy calls, `timeout=60` for batch operations.
- **Capture errors, don't silence them** — surface error info so callers can decide how to handle it:

```python
# BAD — error silently returns empty, caller can't distinguish "no data" from "call failed"
except Exception:
    return {}

# GOOD — error info returned for caller to handle
except Exception as e:
    return {}, {}, f"fetch failed: {e}"
```

### 3.7 Empty Response Guard

When checking MCP responses for failure, use `if not data` instead of `if data is None`. An MCP call can return an empty dict `{}` which passes `is not None` but is still unusable.

```python
# BAD — empty dict {} passes this check, downstream code crashes on missing keys
data = mcporter_call_safe("strategy_get_clearinghouse_state", strategy_wallet=wallet)
if data is None:
    return {}, {}, "fetch failed"

# GOOD — catches both None and empty dict
if not data:
    return {}, {}, "fetch failed"
```

---

## 4. Storage & State Management

### 4.1 Atomic Writes

All state file mutations must be atomic. Never use bare `open("w") + json.dump()`.

```python
import os, json

def atomic_write(path, data):
    """Write JSON atomically — crash-safe."""
    tmp = path + ".tmp"
    with open(tmp, "w") as f:
        json.dump(data, f)
    os.replace(tmp, path)  # atomic on POSIX
```

**Why:** If a cron is killed mid-write (timeout, OOM, signal), a partial `.json` file will crash every subsequent cron run. `os.replace()` is atomic — the file is either the old version or the new version, never corrupt.

### 4.2 Re-Read Before Write (Race Condition Guard)

When multiple crons can modify the same state file, re-read immediately before writing to detect external changes:

```python
# Before writing, check if another cron modified the file
if not should_close:
    try:
        with open(state_file) as f:
            current = json.load(f)
        if not current.get("active", True):
            return  # Another cron already closed this — don't resurrect
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, IOError):
        pass
atomic_write(state_file, state)
```

**Real bug this prevents:** DSL cron reads state → SM flip cron closes position (sets `active: false`) → DSL cron writes state back → position is resurrected.

### 4.3 State Directory Layout

Scope state files to avoid collisions:

```
{workspace}/
├── {skill}-config.json              # Skill-level config (single source of truth)
├── state/
│   ├── {instance-key}/              # Per-instance state (e.g., per-strategy, per-wallet)
│   │   ├── {entity}-{ASSET}.json    # Per-entity state files
│   │   └── monitor-last.json        # Last run state
│   └── {instance-key-2}/
│       └── ...
├── history/
│   ├── {shared-signal}.json         # Market-wide signals (shared across instances)
│   └── scan-history.json            # Cross-run momentum tracking
└── memory/
    └── {skill}-YYYY-MM-DD.md        # Daily logs/reports
```

**Key principle:** Signals are market-wide (shared). Position/instance state is scoped.

### 4.4 State File Schema

Every state file should include:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "active": true,
  "instanceKey": "strategy-abc123",
  "createdAt": "2026-02-20T15:22:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-02-26T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

- `version` — for migration logic when the schema changes
- `active` — deactivate monitoring without deleting the file
- `instanceKey` — back-reference to the owning instance
- `createdAt` / `updatedAt` — audit trail

---

## 5. Configuration Management

### 5.1 Single Source of Truth

Create one shared config module that all scripts import. No script should read config files independently.

```python
# {skill}_config.py — THE config loader

import os, json

WORKSPACE = os.environ.get("OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE", os.path.expanduser("~/.openclaw/workspace"))
CONFIG_FILE = os.path.join(WORKSPACE, "{skill}-config.json")

def load_config():
    """Load skill config with defaults."""
    defaults = {
        "version": 1,
        "maxRetries": 3,
        "alertThreshold": 50,
        # ... all defaults here
    }
    try:
        with open(CONFIG_FILE) as f:
            user_config = json.load(f)
        return deep_merge(defaults, user_config)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return defaults
```

### 5.2 Deep Merge for User Overrides

Never use `dict.update()` on nested configs — it's a shallow merge that silently loses nested keys.

```python
def deep_merge(base, override):
    """Recursively merge override into base. Preserves nested defaults."""
    result = dict(base)
    for key, value in override.items():
        if key in result and isinstance(result[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
            result[key] = deep_merge(result[key], value)
        else:
            result[key] = value
    return result
```

**Real bug this prevents:** User overrides one nested key → `dict.update()` replaces the entire parent dict → all other nested defaults vanish → `KeyError` crash.

### 5.3 Backward-Compatible Defaults

All config values must have sensible defaults so existing setups don't break when new fields are added:

```python
max_minutes = config.get("dsl", {}).get("phase1MaxMinutes", 90)
weak_peak_threshold = config.get("dsl", {}).get("weakPeakThreshold", 3.0)
```

### 5.4 Legacy Auto-Migration

When changing config format, auto-migrate on first load:

```python
def load_config():
    # Try new format first
    if os.path.exists(NEW_CONFIG):
        return json.load(open(NEW_CONFIG))

    # Auto-migrate old format
    if os.path.exists(OLD_CONFIG):
        old = json.load(open(OLD_CONFIG))
        new = migrate_v1_to_v2(old)
        atomic_write(NEW_CONFIG, new)
        return new

    return defaults
```

### 5.5 Percentage Convention

All thresholds and percentages must use **whole numbers** (5 = 5%), never decimals (0.05). Document this explicitly.

```python
# GOOD — percentage convention
retrace_pct = config.get("retraceFromHW", 5)  # 5 = 5%
retrace_decimal = retrace_pct / 100            # convert internally

# Document in state-schema.md:
# `retraceFromHW` is a percentage — use `5` for 5%.
# The code divides by 100 internally. Do NOT use `0.05`.
```

**Why:** Mixed conventions (some fields as 5, others as 0.05) cause subtle bugs that are hard to catch. Pick one convention and enforce it everywhere.

---

## 6. Retry & Resilience

### 6.1 Standard Retry Pattern

All external calls (MCP, subprocess, file I/O to remote paths) should use this pattern:

```python
def call_with_retry(fn, max_attempts=3, delay=3):
    """Retry with fixed delay. Returns result or raises last error."""
    last_error = None
    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        try:
            return fn()
        except Exception as e:
            last_error = e
            if attempt < max_attempts - 1:
                time.sleep(delay)
    raise last_error
```

Apply consistently: **3 attempts, 3-second delays** across all scripts.

### 6.2 Structured Error Output

On total failure, output **valid JSON with error info** — never a raw traceback. This lets the calling LLM parse the response and emit `HEARTBEAT_OK` instead of crashing.

```python
# BAD — raw traceback crashes the cron
raise Exception("API call failed")

# GOOD — structured error, caller can continue
try:
    data = fetch_data()
except Exception as e:
    print(json.dumps({
        "success": False,
        "error": f"fetch_failed: {str(e)}",
        "actionable": False  # tells the LLM: nothing to do
    }))
    sys.exit(1)
```

### 6.3 Self-Healing Scripts

When a script can detect AND fix an issue, do it in the script — don't rely on the LLM to interpret the problem and run manual fixes. Include an `action` field so the cron mandate knows what already happened:

```python
# Script detects orphaned state and auto-fixes
if orphan_detected and not had_fetch_error:
    raw["active"] = False
    raw["closeReason"] = "externally_closed_detected_by_healthcheck"
    atomic_write(dsl_file, raw)
    issues.append({
        "type": "ORPHAN_DSL",
        "action": "auto_deactivated",       # ← script already fixed it
        "message": f"{asset} DSL was active but no position found -- auto-deactivated"
    })
elif orphan_detected and had_fetch_error:
    issues.append({
        "type": "ORPHAN_DSL",
        "action": "skipped_fetch_error",    # ← script couldn't safely fix
        "message": f"{asset} DSL appears orphaned but skipping due to fetch error"
    })
```

**Why:** Budget/Mid models are unreliable at multi-step remediation. Moving fix logic into the script makes it deterministic. The cron mandate just routes the `action` field to "alert" or "ignore."

### 6.4 Graceful Degradation

When a non-critical component fails, continue with reduced functionality instead of aborting:

```python
# Monitoring script: if one data source fails, still check others
alerts = []
try:
    margin_data = call_mcp("account_get_portfolio", wallet=wallet)
    check_margin_buffer(margin_data, alerts)
except Exception as e:
    alerts.append({"level": "WARNING", "msg": f"margin_check_failed: {e}"})

try:
    positions = call_mcp("execution_get_positions", wallet=wallet)
    check_position_health(positions, alerts)
except Exception as e:
    alerts.append({"level": "WARNING", "msg": f"position_check_failed: {e}"})

# Still produces useful output even if one source failed
print(json.dumps({"alerts": alerts, "partial": True}))
```

## 7. Cron Job Best Practices

### 7.1 Cron Template Format

Crons use one of two formats depending on session type (see Section 2.6):

**Main session** — `systemEvent` format (Primary model, shared context):

```json
{
  "name": "{Skill Name} — {Job Name}",
  "schedule": { "kind": "every", "everyMs": 90000 },
  "sessionTarget": "main",
  "wakeMode": "now",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "systemEvent",
    "text": "..."
  }
}
```

**Isolated session** — `agentTurn` format (Mid/Budget model, fresh context):

```json
{
  "name": "{Skill Name} — {Job Name}",
  "schedule": { "kind": "every", "everyMs": 90000 },
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "model": "<Mid or Budget tier model ID>",
    "message": "..."
  }
}
```

**Critical differences:**

| | Main (systemEvent) | Isolated (agentTurn) |
|---|---|---|
| `sessionTarget` | `"main"` | `"isolated"` |
| `wakeMode` | `"now"` (required) | Not used (omit it) |
| `payload.kind` | `"systemEvent"` | `"agentTurn"` |
| Mandate key | `"text"` | `"message"` |
| Model | Agent's configured model | Specified in `payload.model` |

> **Warning:** `systemEvent` uses `"text"`, `agentTurn` uses `"message"`. Using the wrong key silently fails — the cron fires but the LLM receives an empty prompt.

### 7.2 Mandate Text Pattern — Explicit Rules for Budget/Mid Models

Cron mandates typically run on Budget or Mid tier models. These models **cannot make judgment calls** — they need deterministic, per-case rules. Never say "apply rules from SKILL.md" in a Budget/Mid mandate.

```
# BAD — vague, requires judgment (Budget model will hallucinate)
"Parse JSON. Apply WOLF SM rules from SKILL.md for judgment calls.
If hasFlipSignal=false → HEARTBEAT_OK."

# GOOD — explicit per-case branching (Budget model follows steps)
"Parse JSON. For each alert in `alerts`:
if `alertLevel == "FLIP_NOW"` → close that position, alert Telegram ({TELEGRAM}).
Ignore alerts with `alertLevel` of WATCH or FLIP_WARNING (no action needed).
If `hasFlipSignal == false` or no FLIP_NOW alerts → HEARTBEAT_OK."
```

```
# BAD — "fix immediately" is vague
"CRITICAL issues → fix immediately, alert Telegram."

# GOOD — explicit per-type instructions
"Fix issues by type:
- auto_created → DSL was missing, script created it. Alert Telegram.
- auto_deactivated → Orphan DSL deactivated. No alert needed.
- alert_only → Script could not auto-fix. Alert Telegram.
If no issues → HEARTBEAT_OK."
```

**Rule of thumb:** If the mandate says "judgment" or "apply rules," it's too vague for Budget/Mid. Rewrite with explicit `if/then` per output field.

### 7.3 One Set of Crons, Scripts Iterate Internally

Don't create separate crons per instance/wallet/strategy. Scripts should load the config and iterate:

```python
from my_skill_config import load_all_instances

for key, cfg in load_all_instances().items():
    process(key, cfg)
```

### 7.4 Use Timeouts

Wrap script execution in `timeout` for heavy jobs:

```
Run `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 timeout 180 python3 scripts/heavy-scan.py`
```

### 7.5 Delete Dead Code

When a script is superseded, delete it. Don't keep legacy files "for reference" — they cause confusion about which file is canonical. Git history is the reference.

### 7.6 Document Field Name Gotchas

If a config field name differs from what you'd expect, document it explicitly:

```markdown
## Gotchas
- `stagnation.thresholdHours` is the correct key. Using `staleHours` will be silently ignored.
- `phase2.retraceFromHW` is a percentage — use `5` for 5%.
```

### 7.7 Slot Guard Pattern

When a skill has resource limits (e.g., max concurrent positions, strategy slots, budget caps), the **script** must surface availability — the agent should never count state files or compute capacity itself.

**Script surfaces availability in JSON output:**

```python
# In your script — count active state files and report
active_states = [f for f in os.listdir(state_dir) if f.endswith(".json")]
active_count = sum(1 for f in active_states if load_json(f).get("active"))
max_slots = config.get("maxSlots", 5)

output["strategySlots"] = {
    "active": active_count,
    "max": max_slots,
    "available": max_slots - active_count,
    "anySlotsAvailable": active_count < max_slots
}
```

**Mandate includes a SLOT GUARD directive:**

```
SLOT GUARD (MANDATORY):
Check `strategySlots.anySlotsAvailable` BEFORE opening any new position.
If false → skip entry, log "no slots available", continue to next signal.
Never open a position without confirming slot availability first.
```

**Key principles:**

- **Script is the source of truth** — the script counts state files, computes capacity, and reports it. The agent reads the field and acts on it.
- **Agent never globs state files** — if the agent is counting files to determine capacity, the script contract is broken. Fix the script.
- **Pattern generalizes** — any resource limit (slots, budget remaining, rate limits, cooldowns) should be surfaced the same way: script computes, outputs a guard field, mandate enforces checking it.
- **Guard is mandatory, not advisory** — the mandate must include explicit "MANDATORY" language. Budget/Mid models skip soft suggestions.

### 7.8 Setup Script Conventions

When a skill has a setup script that generates cron configurations, follow these conventions:

**Parameterize model IDs via CLI args:**

```python
parser.add_argument("--mid-model", default="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
                    help="Model ID for Mid-tier isolated crons")
parser.add_argument("--budget-model", default="anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
                    help="Model ID for Budget-tier isolated crons")
```

This makes the skill provider-agnostic — users on OpenAI or Google can pass their own model IDs without editing the script.

**Inject model into cron payloads:**

```python
# Setup script generates cron payloads with the user's chosen models
"payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "model": mid_model,    # ← from CLI arg, not hardcoded
    "message": "..."
}
```

**Show model assignments in setup output** so users can verify before creating crons.

### 7.9 Placeholder Scope Hygiene

Cron template placeholders must match the actual file location scope. Common scopes:

| Placeholder | Scope | Example |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `{WORKSPACE}` | Workspace root | `/data/workspace` — for config files, state dirs |
| `{SCRIPTS}` | Skill's scripts dir | `/data/workspace/skills/{skill}/scripts` |
| `{SKILL}` | Skill root dir | `/data/workspace/skills/{skill}` |

**Rule:** If a file lives at the workspace root (e.g., `wolf-strategies.json`, `state/`), use `{WORKSPACE}`. If it lives inside the skill directory, use `{SCRIPTS}` or `{SKILL}`. Mismatched placeholders cause the LLM to reference non-existent paths.

Verify placeholder accuracy by cross-checking against the config loader (e.g., `wolf_config.py`) which defines the canonical paths.

### 7.10 Cron Heartbeat Monitoring

Detect stuck or dead crons by writing a heartbeat at the start of each script execution. A separate health-check cron reads all heartbeats and alerts when any cron hasn't reported in.

**Script-side — write heartbeat:**

```python
import json, os, time
from my_skill_config import atomic_write

HEARTBEAT_FILE = os.path.join(WORKSPACE, "state", "cron-heartbeats.json")

def heartbeat(cron_name):
    """Record this cron's last execution time."""
    try:
        with open(HEARTBEAT_FILE) as f:
            beats = json.load(f)
    except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
        beats = {}
    beats[cron_name] = {"lastRun": time.time(), "status": "ok"}
    atomic_write(HEARTBEAT_FILE, beats)

# Call at the top of every script
heartbeat("emerging_movers")
```

**Health-check cron — read and alert:**

```python
stale_threshold = interval_seconds * 3  # e.g., 3min cron → 9min threshold

for name, info in beats.items():
    age = time.time() - info["lastRun"]
    if age > stale_threshold:
        alerts.append(f"STALE CRON: {name} last ran {age/60:.0f}m ago (threshold: {stale_threshold/60:.0f}m)")
```

**Key principles:**
- Threshold should be ~3x the cron's expected interval (gives room for occasional delays)
- Uses `atomic_write` to the shared heartbeat file — same crash-safety as all state writes
- Health-check cron itself should run on Budget tier (simple threshold comparison)

### 7.11 Cron Pruning

Periodically evaluate each cron's token cost vs. value delivered. If a cron rarely produces actionable signals, consider removing it or increasing its interval. Track the ratio of `HEARTBEAT_OK` runs to actionable runs — a cron that's 99% heartbeats is burning tokens for marginal value. Fewer, more focused crons are better than many low-value crons.

---

## 8. Defensive Coding

### 8.1 Validate Agent-Generated State

Values written by agents (LLMs) may have wrong signs or types. Defend against this:

```python
# Agent may write negative values for fields that should be positive
retrace = abs(state["retraceThreshold"])

# Enforce percentage convention — always whole numbers, always /100
retrace_decimal = retrace / 100
```

### 8.2 Prefer Extending Functions Over Creating New Ones

When a new context needs the same data (e.g., a second DEX), add a parameter to the existing function instead of creating a new one:

```python
# BAD — separate function per context (code duplication)
def fetch_crypto_prices(): ...
def fetch_xyz_prices(): ...

# GOOD — one function with optional parameter
def fetch_all_mids(dex=None):
    kwargs = {"dex": dex} if dex else {}
    data = mcporter_call("market_get_prices", **kwargs)
    return data.get("prices", {})

# Usage
crypto_prices = fetch_all_mids()
xyz_prices = fetch_all_mids(dex="xyz")
```

### 8.3 Safe Initialization

Choose defaults carefully — they depend on the field's semantics:

```python
# Tracking fields (peak, high water) — default to current value
# BAD — peak starts at 0, never reflects the actual entry state
peak_roe = state.get("peakROE", 0)

# GOOD — peak starts at current ROE, tracks upward from actual entry
peak_roe = state.get("peakROE", current_roe)

# Counter fields (breaches, failures) — default to zero
breach_count = state.get("currentBreachCount", 0)
fetch_failures = state.get("consecutiveFetchFailures", 0)
```

**Rule:** Tracking values (peaks, high water marks) default to the current observed value. Counters default to zero.

### 8.4 Config-Driven Magic Numbers

Never hardcode tunable constants. Read from config with defaults:

```python
# BAD
if minutes_elapsed > 90:  # hardcoded

# GOOD
max_minutes = config.get("phase1MaxMinutes", 90)
if minutes_elapsed > max_minutes:
```

### 8.5 Backward-Compatible Key Fallbacks

When config keys get renamed, chain `.get()` calls so old configs still work:

```python
# Field was renamed from "staleHours" to "thresholdHours"
stale_hours = cfg.get("thresholdHours", cfg.get("staleHours", 1.0))
```

This is cheaper than writing a migration and avoids breaking existing deployments.

### 8.6 API Field Name Conventions

External APIs may return the same field under different naming conventions or different field names across versions/endpoints. Handle with `or` fallbacks:

```python
# snake_case vs camelCase for same field
lev = inst.get("max_leverage") or inst.get("maxLeverage")

# Different field names across API versions for the same concept
asset = m.get("token") or m.get("asset") or m.get("coin", "")
traders = int(m.get("trader_count", m.get("traderCount", 0)) or 0)
```

When the same value has different **units** across fields, check which field is present:

```python
# pct_of_top_traders_gain is decimal (0.15), pnlContribution is already percent (15)
raw_pnl = data.get("pct_of_top_traders_gain")
if raw_pnl is not None:
    pnl_pct = float(raw_pnl) * 100      # decimal → percent
else:
    pnl_pct = float(data.get("pnlContribution", 0))  # already percent
```

### 8.7 Percentage Convention — Always Divide by 100

Never write "smart" detection logic that guesses whether a value is a percentage or a decimal:

```python
# BAD — ambiguous, breaks when value is exactly 1
retrace_decimal = retrace / 100 if retrace > 1 else retrace

# GOOD — enforce "all percentages are whole numbers" and always divide
retrace_decimal = retrace / 100
```

Enforce the convention at the config layer (see Section 5.5) and trust it in the code. If the value is wrong, fix the config — don't add branching logic.

### 8.8 Path Hygiene with Prefixed Identifiers

When identifiers carry scope prefixes (e.g., `xyz:BTC`), strip them before using as file paths:

```python
# Coin might be "xyz:AAPL" — can't use colon in filenames
clean_coin = coin.replace("xyz:", "")
path = os.path.join(state_dir, f"dsl-{clean_coin}.json")
```

Always strip prefixes at the boundary where you create file paths, not inside business logic.

### 8.9 Dynamic Parameter Calculation

Compute operational parameters from config + context rather than hardcoding tiers. Instead of maintaining separate value tables per budget size or risk level, use a formula that scales with the inputs.

```python
# BAD — hardcoded leverage tiers
if budget < 500:
    leverage = 3
elif budget < 2000:
    leverage = 5
else:
    leverage = 10

# GOOD — risk-driven calculation from config
risk_tiers = config.get("riskTiers", {
    "conservative": {"min": 0.1, "max": 0.3},
    "moderate":     {"min": 0.3, "max": 0.6},
    "aggressive":   {"min": 0.6, "max": 0.9}
})

risk_label = config.get("riskLabel", "moderate")
tier = risk_tiers[risk_label]
max_leverage = config.get("maxLeverage", 10)

# leverage = maxLeverage × riskRange × conviction
leverage = round(max_leverage * tier["max"] * conviction_score, 1)
leverage = max(1, min(leverage, max_leverage))  # clamp to bounds
```

**Key principles:**
- Define risk tiers in config with percentage ranges — not in code
- Scripts compute the parameter and include it in the output — don't leave math to the LLM
- The formula `parameter = maxValue × riskRange × conviction` generalizes to margin sizing, position sizing, stop-loss distances, and any tunable operational parameter
- Clamping (`max/min`) prevents out-of-bounds values regardless of input

## 9. Script Output Contract

Every script must output a single JSON object to stdout. This is the contract between the script and the cron mandate.

### 9.1 Success Case

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "signals": [...],
  "actions": [...],
  "summary": "2 entries, 1 close"
}
```

### 9.2 Nothing Actionable

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "heartbeat": "HEARTBEAT_OK"
}
```

### 9.3 Error Case

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "market_data_fetch_failed: timeout after 3 attempts",
  "actionable": false
}
```

### 9.4 Verbose Mode

Gate diagnostic output behind an environment variable:

```python
VERBOSE = os.environ.get("{SKILL}_VERBOSE") == "1"

output = build_minimal_output(results)
if VERBOSE:
    output["debug"] = build_debug_output(results)

print(json.dumps(output))
```

### 9.5 Action-Only Output Filtering

Scripts should only include items the LLM needs to act on. Filter out non-actionable items at the script level — don't leave it to the LLM to skip them.

```python
# BAD — includes all positions, LLM must figure out which need action
for pos in positions:
    alerts.append({"asset": pos["asset"], "flipped": pos["flipped"], ...})

# GOOD — only include items that need action
for pos in positions:
    if pos["flipped"]:
        alerts.append({"asset": pos["asset"], ...})
```

**Why:** Budget/Mid models waste tokens reasoning about non-actionable items. Every item in the output array implies "do something with this." Filtering at the script level reduces tokens and prevents false-positive actions.

### 9.6 Notification Decision Ownership

**Scripts own notification logic, not the LLM.** The script builds a `notifications` array with pre-formatted, ready-to-send messages. The cron mandate simply sends them — no judgment required.

```python
# Script builds notifications list
notifications = []
for item in closed_positions:
    notifications.append(f"CLOSED {item['asset']}: {item['reason']} | PnL: {item['pnl']}")

for item in opened_positions:
    notifications.append(f"OPENED {item['asset']} {item['direction']} | Margin: ${item['margin']}")

output["notifications"] = notifications
```

The cron mandate becomes minimal:

```
Send each message in `notifications` to Telegram ({TELEGRAM}).
If `notifications` is empty → HEARTBEAT_OK.
```

**Why this matters:**
- Isolated sessions have no memory — without script-owned logic, the LLM re-fires informational warnings every cycle
- Budget/Mid models misapply complex notification rules (e.g., "only alert on first occurrence" requires state they don't have)
- Notification spam from non-actionable alerts is the #1 user complaint

**Notification Policy** — what to include in the `notifications` array:

| NOTIFY (include in array) | NEVER NOTIFY (omit from array) |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Trade actions taken (open, close, adjust) | Warnings without action taken |
| Auto-fixes applied (orphan cleanup, state repair) | Informational output (market summary, scan stats) |
| Critical alerts requiring user attention | Transient errors (retried successfully) |
| Position state changes (liquidation risk, TP hit) | Internal bookkeeping (heartbeats, state updates) |

**Rule of thumb:** If the notification doesn't prompt the user to do something or inform them of something that already happened, it doesn't belong in the array.

---

## 10. Notification Consolidation

Send ONE notification per cron run, not one per signal/action.

```python
# BAD — 5 signals = 5 Telegram messages = spam
for signal in signals:
    send_telegram(f"Signal: {signal['asset']}")

# GOOD — 1 consolidated message
if signals:
    summary = ", ".join(f"{s['asset']} {s['direction']}" for s in signals)
    # Output for LLM to send: "Entered 3 positions: HYPE LONG, SOL SHORT, ETH LONG"
```

The script outputs the consolidated summary; the agent LLM sends the single Telegram.

---

## 11. Reuse Existing Data

Before making a new API call, check if the data is already available from a previous call in the same run.

```python
# BAD — separate API call just for volume trend
volume_trend = call_mcp("market_get_volume_trend", asset=asset)

# GOOD — compute from candles already fetched
def compute_volume_trend(candles_1h):
    mid = len(candles_1h) // 2
    prior_avg = sum(c["volume"] for c in candles_1h[:mid]) / max(mid, 1)
    recent_avg = sum(c["volume"] for c in candles_1h[mid:]) / max(len(candles_1h) - mid, 1)
    return recent_avg / prior_avg if prior_avg > 0 else 1.0
```

---

## 12. Safety & Monitoring

### 12.1 Widen Alert Thresholds

Set warning thresholds with generous buffer. It's better to alert early than to miss a critical event.

```python
# Conservative thresholds
MARGIN_WARNING = 50    # warn at 50%, not 30%
MARGIN_CRITICAL = 30   # critical at 30%, not 15%
```

### 12.2 Cross-Metric Alerting

Compare related metrics to catch dangerous states:

```python
# If liquidation is closer than the stop loss, the stop loss is useless
if liq_distance_pct < stop_loss_distance_pct:
    alerts.append({
        "level": "CRITICAL",
        "msg": f"Liquidation ({liq_distance_pct:.1f}%) closer than stop loss ({stop_loss_distance_pct:.1f}%)"
    })
```

### 12.3 Unused Variable Convention

Use `_` prefix for intentionally unused variables:

```python
for key, _ in load_all_strategies():   # don't need cfg here
    ...

def handler(_meta, _config, data):      # interface requires these params
    return process(data)
```
