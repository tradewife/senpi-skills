# Senpi Agent Entrypoint

Onboard an AI agent into the Senpi trading platform on Hyperliquid via
modular skills: account setup, skill discovery, and trading strategies.

For platform context (wallets, strategies, tool categories, fees), see
[references/about-senpi.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills/refs/heads/main/senpi-entrypoint/references/about-senpi.md).


If any `npx` command fails, consult
[references/error-handling.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills/refs/heads/main/senpi-entrypoint/references/error-handling.md) for recovery
steps.

## Environment Variable Defaults

| Variable | Placeholder | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SENPI_MCP_ENDPOINT` | `{{SENPI_MCP_ENDPOINT}}` | `https://mcp.prod.senpi.ai` |
| `REFERRAL_CODE` | `{{REFERRAL_CODE}}` | _(empty — optional)_ |

If a placeholder appears as a literal `{{...}}` string (not substituted),
use the default value from the table above.

## Agent Behavior

Do not narrate or explain tool calls. Execute silently and only present final results to the user.

---

## Initial check: Skip only Step 1 if already authenticated

Before Step 1, check whether the machine already has a Senpi API key available:

```bash
if [ -n "${SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN}" ]; then
  # Optional: verify MCP responds (e.g. call a read-only tool)
  # If verification fails, clear or ignore and continue to Step 1
  echo "SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN is set; skipping Step 1 only. You MUST still run Step 2, then Step 3, then Step 4."
  SKIP_ONBOARDING=true
else
  SKIP_ONBOARDING=false
fi
```

- **If `SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN` is set and (optionally) MCP responds:** Skip **only Step 1** (Onboard). You **MUST** still run **Step 2: Discover** (list skills and present the catalog to the user), then **Step 3: Guide**, then **Step 4: Expand**. Do not treat "token is set" as "onboarding complete — do nothing."
- **If `SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN` is unset or empty:** Proceed to **Step 1: Onboard** as usual.

After the initial check, follow the step flow: Step 1 (unless skipped) → **Step 2 (always)** → Step 3 → Step 4.

---

## Step 1: Onboard

**Run this step only when** `SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN` is not set (i.e. `SKIP_ONBOARDING` is false). If you skipped here from the initial check, go to Step 2.

Install the onboarding skill:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --skill senpi-onboard -g -y
```

Load and follow the `senpi-onboard` skill instructions. Pass this context:
- `SENPI_MCP_ENDPOINT`: {{SENPI_MCP_ENDPOINT}}
- `REFERRAL_CODE`: {{REFERRAL_CODE}}

**Gate — verify before proceeding:**
1. Senpi account exists
2. API key is generated
3. MCP server is configured and responds to a tool call

---

## Step 2: Discover

**Run this step always:** after Step 1 completes, or immediately when the initial check found `SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN` set. Do not skip this step when the user already has a token — they still need to see the skill catalog.

List available trading skills:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --list
```

Present the catalog to the user. If the command fails, point the user to the
official [Senpi Skills repository](https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills)
to browse available skills.

**Gate — verify before proceeding:** User has seen the skill catalog.

---

## Step 3: Guide (Optional)

Ask the user:

> "Would you like to learn how to trade on Senpi? I can walk you through
> your first trade with an interactive guide."

If the user agrees, install the Senpi getting started guide:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --skill senpi-getting-started-guide -g -y
```

If the guide skill is not yet available, suggest these first actions instead:
- "Check your portfolio" (uses `account_get_portfolio` tool)
- "Discover top traders" (uses `discovery_get_top_traders` tool)
- "View market data" (uses `market_get_prices` tool)

---

## Step 4: Expand (User-Driven)

Install additional trading skills on demand based on user interest:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --skill <skill-name> -g -y
```

Example:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --skill wolf-strategy -g -y
```

Onboarding is complete. The agent is now equipped with Senpi's trading
toolkit and can install more skills as needed.

---

## Step 5: Skill Update Check (silent, always runs)

Run this step after Step 4 completes. It checks for new or updated Senpi
skills and surfaces them to the user only when there is something relevant.

### Locate the script

Find the `scripts/` directory for this skill — it is relative to wherever
`senpi-entrypoint` was installed globally on this machine:

```bash
SENPI_ENTRYPOINT_SCRIPTS=$(node -e "
  const path = require('path'), os = require('os'), fs = require('fs');
  const p = path.join(os.homedir(), '.agents', 'skills', 'senpi-entrypoint', 'scripts');
  console.log(fs.existsSync(path.join(p, 'check-skill-updates.py')) ? p : '');
" 2>/dev/null)
```

If `SENPI_ENTRYPOINT_SCRIPTS` is empty, skip this step silently — the skill
may not be installed globally yet.

### Run the check

```bash
[ -n "$SENPI_ENTRYPOINT_SCRIPTS" ] && \
  UPDATE_OUTPUT=$(python3 "$SENPI_ENTRYPOINT_SCRIPTS/check-skill-updates.py" 2>/dev/null)
```

### Act on the output

Parse `UPDATE_OUTPUT` as JSON:

- **`heartbeat: "HEARTBEAT_OK"`** — Nothing new. Say nothing, do nothing.

- **`updatedSkills[]` is non-empty** — For each entry, present:
  > **{name}** updated: v{oldVersion} → v{newVersion}
  > Run `npx skills update` to apply all updates at once.

- **`newSkills[]` is non-empty** — For each entry, present:
  > **New skill available: {name}** v{version} — {description}
  > Install: `npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --skill {name} -g -y`

Do **not** announce that you ran the check. Only speak if there is
something to surface.

---

## Turning off skill update notifications

If at any point the user says something like "turn off skill update
notifications", "stop notifying me about new skills", or similar:

```bash
node -e "
  const fs = require('fs');
  const p = require('os').homedir() + '/.config/senpi/state.json';
  try {
    const s = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(p, 'utf8'));
    s.skillUpdates = { enabled: false };
    fs.writeFileSync(p, JSON.stringify(s, null, 2));
    console.log('done');
  } catch(e) { console.log('state file not found'); }
"
```

Confirm to the user that skill update notifications are off. They can
re-enable by saying "turn on skill update notifications", which sets
`skillUpdates.enabled` to `true` using the same pattern above.

---

## Responding to Questions

Handle these questions at any point — during onboarding or after it completes.

### "What skills should I install?" / "What should I use for [goal]?"

First run:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --list
```

Then match the user's stated goal to the table below and recommend the
best-fit skill(s). Always include the minimum budget and install command.

| User goal | Recommended skill | Min budget |
|---|---|---|
| Protect profits on open positions / trailing stop loss | `dsl-dynamic-stop-loss` or `dsl-tight` (tighter defaults) | $100 |
| Scan all markets for high-conviction setups | `opportunity-scanner` | $100 |
| Catch smart money moves early, before they hit the leaderboard | `emerging-movers` | $100 |
| Fully autonomous trading — no manual decisions needed | `wolf-strategy` ⭐ (includes DSL, Scanner, Emerging Movers) | $500 |
| Mirror the best-performing traders automatically | `whale-index` | $500 |
| Orchestrate DSL + Scanner + Emerging Movers on one budget | `autonomous-trading` | $500 |
| Nightly trade review and self-improvement loop | `wolf-howl` (requires `wolf-strategy`) | — |

For each recommendation, present:
- Skill name + one-sentence description
- Minimum budget
- Install command: `npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --skill <name> -g -y`

If the user's budget is under $500, steer toward `dsl-dynamic-stop-loss`
or `opportunity-scanner` to start. If they have $500+, `wolf-strategy` is
the most complete autonomous option.

If the user's goal is unclear, ask one question: **"Are you looking to
protect existing positions, find new ones, or have the agent trade
autonomously?"** — then map their answer to the table above.
