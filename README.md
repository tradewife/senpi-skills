# Senpi AI Skills

Skills give your Senpi agent superpowers — pre-built trading strategies and tools that work out of the box. Built on the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard.

---

## Install a skill (Senpi users)

1. Download the `SKILL.md` file (click the link in the table below)
2. Send it to your agent in Telegram with the message: **"Here are some new superpowers"**
3. Your agent will prompt you for next steps

> **Tip:** Use top-tier AI models (Claude Opus or equivalent). Trading requires precision. Skills are optimized to use far fewer tokens than training your agent from scratch.

## Skill details

### DSL (Dynamic Stop Loss)

Automated trailing stop loss for leveraged perp positions on Hyperliquid. All tier triggers are ROE-based (return on margin), so they automatically account for leverage.

**How it works:** Two phases — Phase 1 ("Let it breathe") uses a wide retrace with multiple breach checks to avoid early shakeouts. Phase 2 ("Lock the bag") triggers on the first profit tier, tightens the retrace (optionally per-tier), and ratchets a profit floor upward that can never go back down. The script closes positions directly via mcporter with retry — no agent intervention needed for the critical path.

**Key features:** ROE-based tier ratcheting, per-tier retrace, breach decay modes, error handling with close retry and `pendingClose` recovery. Self-contained: one Python script + one JSON state file.

📥 **[Download SKILL.md](dsl-dynamic-stop-loss/SKILL.md)**

---

### DSL-Tight

A tighter, more opinionated variant of DSL for aggressive profit protection. Uses the same script and architecture as DSL v5 — strategy-scoped cron, one state file per position under a strategy dir.

**How it works:** Same engine as DSL v5 (`dsl-v5.py`). DSL-Tight is a preset with tighter defaults: 5% Phase 1 retrace, 2 breaches to close in Phase 2, 4 tiers (50→65→75→85% lock) with per-tier retrace. Absolute floor is auto-calculated when omitted. Install the dsl-dynamic-stop-loss skill first; DSL-Tight only defines the state file template and defaults.

📥 **[Download SKILL.md](dsl-tight/SKILL.md)**

---

### Opportunity Scanner

Screens all Hyperliquid perps to find the highest-conviction trading setups.

**How it works:** 4-stage funnel — BTC macro context, bulk volume screen, smart money overlay, multi-timeframe deep dive with parallel candle fetches. Scores 0–400 across 4 equal pillars, gated by hourly trend alignment. Counter-trend on hourly = hard skip. Near-zero LLM tokens.

📥 **[Download SKILL.md](opportunity-scanner/SKILL.md)**

---

### Autonomous Trading

Give your agent a budget, a target, and a deadline. It does the rest.

**How it works:** Creates a strategy wallet, scans for opportunities, opens positions, protects profits with DSL, and enforces risk controls. Race condition prevention across crons, conviction collapse = instant cut, cross-margin buffer math, speed filter.

**Requires:** DSL + Opportunity Scanner + Emerging Movers skills
**Minimum budget:** $500 (recommend $1k+)

📥 **[Download SKILL.md](autonomous-trading/SKILL.md)**

---

### WOLF Strategy

Fully autonomous trading — the WOLF hunts for its human. All 7 Python scripts bundled, setup wizard, cron mandate templates.

**How it works:** 2-3 slot concentrated position management. IMMEDIATE_MOVER as primary entry trigger. 7 cron jobs (60s scanner, 180s DSL per position, 5min SM flip detector, 5min watchdog, 15min scanner, 15min portfolio, 10min health check). Budget-scaled sizing — tell it your budget, it calculates slots, margin, leverage, loss limits, and auto-delevers if account drops. Tighter 4-tier DSL (5/10/15/20% ROE) locks profit earlier than the old 6-tier system.

**Proven:** +$1,500 realized across 25+ trades, 65% win rate on $6.5k budget.

**Self-contained:** Includes DSL v4, Emerging Movers, Opportunity Scanner, SM flip detector, watchdog, health check, and setup wizard. No companion skill installs needed.

### HOWL

🐺🌙 **Hunt, Optimize, Win, Learn.** The WOLF hunts all day. At night, it HOWLs — reviewing every trade, finding patterns, and sharpening itself for tomorrow.

**How it works:** A nightly cron spawns an isolated sub-agent that gathers trade history, DSL state files, and memory logs. It computes win rates, profit factor, signal quality correlation, DSL tier distribution, slot utilization, and missed opportunities. Produces a structured report with data-backed improvement suggestions at high/medium/low confidence, saves to memory, and sends a Telegram summary.

**Requires:** WOLF Strategy skill (this analyzes WOLF's trades)

📥 **[Download SKILL.md](wolf-howl/SKILL.md)**

---

### Emerging Movers Detector

Catches Smart Money rotations before they hit the top of the leaderboard.

**How it works:** Tracks SM profit concentration leaderboard every 60 seconds using a single API call. Scans top 50 markets. v3.1 adds quality filters — erratic rank history, velocity gate, trader count floor, max leverage check — to prevent false IMMEDIATE signals.

📥 **[Download SKILL.md](emerging-movers/SKILL.md)**

---

### Whale Index

Auto-mirror the highest-conviction traders from Senpi's 30-day Discovery leaderboard.

**How it works:** Scans top 50 Discovery traders, scores on PnL rank (35%), win rate (25%), consistency (20%), hold time (10%), drawdown (10%). Creates 2–5 mirror strategies with overlap checks. Daily rebalance with 2-day watch period before swaps.

**Minimum budget:** $500 (recommend $1k+)

## What are Agent Skills?

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) is an open standard for giving AI agents new capabilities. Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that any compatible agent can discover and use. The standard is adopted by Claude, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, VS Code, OpenClaw, and 20+ other platforms.

These skills are built for Senpi on Hyperliquid, but the format is portable — any agent that supports the Agent Skills standard can read and execute them.
