## Shared Infrastructure

These are plugins used by all skills automatically. Users don't need to install them separately.

| Plugin | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [DSL Dynamic Stop Loss](./dsl-dynamic-stop-loss) | Trailing stop engine. Supports fixed ROE tiers and [High Water Mode](./dsl-dynamic-stop-loss/dsl-high-water-spec%201.0.md) (percentage-of-peak locks). |
| [Fee Optimizer](./fee-optimizer) | When to use ALO vs MARKET, standard order params, fee computations (FDR, maker %). |

## DSL High Water Mode

The trailing stop configuration originally designed for and proven on FOX. Instead of locking fixed ROE amounts, High Water Mode locks a percentage of the peak. The stop trails at 85% of the highest ROE the trade has ever reached, with no ceiling.

**Full spec:** [dsl-high-water-spec 1.0.md](./dsl-dynamic-stop-loss/dsl-high-water-spec%201.0.md)

**Adoption guide (all skills):** [dsl-high-water-adoption-guide.md](./dsl-dynamic-stop-loss/dsl-high-water-adoption-guide.md)

## Architecture

```
Plugins ──→ Skills ──→ Trading Strategies
(shared)     (scanner)   (config override)
```

**Plugins** are shared infrastructure — trailing stops, risk management, fee optimization. Maintained once, every skill benefits.

**Skills** are the trading logic — the scanner that embodies a thesis about how to make money. FOX's First Jump detector. VIPER's range analysis. OWL's crowding exhaustion. Each skill is a thin layer on top of shared plugins.

**Trading Strategies** are saved configurations — the specific numbers that tune how aggressively a skill behaves. LYNX is FOX's scanner with score 10+ filters. LION is TIGER's scanners with no time exits. The skill is the predator. The strategy is how you teach it to hunt.

## Quick Start

1. Deploy [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) with [Senpi](https://senpi.ai) MCP configured
2. Install a skill: `npx skills add Senpi-ai/senpi-skills/<skill-name>`
3. The agent reads SKILL.md, runs bootstrap, creates crons, and starts trading
4. Monitor via Telegram alerts and [strategies.senpi.ai](https://strategies.senpi.ai)

**Recommended first skill:** FOX — proven +18% ROI, includes copy trading + autonomous mode.

## Requirements

- [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) agent with cron support
- [Senpi](https://senpi.ai) MCP access token
- Python 3.8+ (no external dependencies — all skills use stdlib only)

## Contributing

Each skill is self-contained in its own directory. Trading strategies are config override files (JSON + markdown spec). See any skill's SKILL.md for the full agent instructions.

All skills use [DSL High Water Mode](./dsl-dynamic-stop-loss/dsl-high-water-spec%201.0.md) as the target trailing stop configuration. See the [adoption guide](./dsl-dynamic-stop-loss/dsl-high-water-adoption-guide.md) for per-skill tier tables.

**When adding a new skill**, add an entry to [`catalog.json`](./catalog.json). This file is the machine-readable registry used by the onboarding agent to present skills to users. Each entry needs an `id`, `name`, `emoji`, `tagline`, `group`, and `sort_order` — see existing entries for reference.
