## Install a skill (Senpi users)

1. Download the `SKILL.md` file (click the link in the table below)
2. Send it to your agent in Telegram with the message: **"Here are some new superpowers"**
3. Your agent will prompt you for next steps

> **Tip:** Use top-tier AI models (Claude Opus or equivalent). Trading requires precision. Skills are optimized to use far fewer tokens than training your agent from scratch.

## Skill details

### DSL (Dynamic Stop Loss)

Automated trailing stop loss for leveraged perp positions on Hyperliquid. All tier triggers are ROE-based (return on margin), so they automatically account for leverage.

**How it works:** Two phases — Phase 1 ("Let it breathe") uses a wide retrace with multiple breach checks to avoid early shakeouts. Phase 2 ("Lock the bag") triggers on the first profit tier, tightens the retrace (optionally per-tier), and ratchets a profit floor upward that can never go back down. The script closes positions directly via mcporter with retry — no agent intervention needed for the critical path.

**Key features:** ROE-based tier ratcheting, per-tier retrace, breach decay modes, error handling with close retry and `pendingClose` recovery. Self-contained: one Python script + one JSON state file.

### DSL-Tight

A tighter, more opinionated variant of DSL for aggressive profit protection. Same ROE-based engine — different defaults.

**How it works:** Same core as DSL v4. DSL-Tight ships with aggressive defaults and fewer knobs. 4 tiers that lock 50→65→75→85% of the high-water move, with breach counts that tighten as profit grows (3→2→2→1). Auto-calculates all price floors. Stagnation take-profit auto-closes if ROE ≥ 8% but the high-water mark hasn't improved for 1 hour.

### Opportunity Scanner

Screens all Hyperliquid perps to find the highest-conviction trading setups.

**How it works:** 4-stage funnel — BTC macro context, bulk volume screen, smart money overlay, multi-timeframe deep dive with parallel candle fetches. Scores 0–400 across 4 equal pillars, gated by hourly trend alignment. Counter-trend on hourly = hard skip. Near-zero LLM tokens.

### Autonomous Trading

Give your agent a budget, a target, and a deadline. It does the rest.

**How it works:** Creates a strategy wallet, scans for opportunities, opens positions, protects profits with DSL, and enforces risk controls. Race condition prevention across crons, conviction collapse = instant cut, cross-margin buffer math, speed filter.

**Requires:** DSL + Opportunity Scanner + Emerging Movers skills
**Minimum budget:** $500 (recommend $1k+)

---

### WOLF Strategy

Aggressive autonomous trading optimized for concentrated 2-slot position management.

**How it works:** Mechanical exits, discretionary entries. IMMEDIATE_MOVER as primary entry trigger, DSL v4 handles all exits. 7 cron jobs. Favors aggressive rotation into higher-conviction setups.

**Proven:** +$750 realized across 14 trades, 64% win rate in a single session.

**Requires:** DSL + Opportunity Scanner + Emerging Movers skills

---

### Emerging Movers Detector

Catches Smart Money rotations before they hit the top of the leaderboard.

**How it works:** Tracks SM profit concentration leaderboard every 60 seconds using a single API call. Scans top 50 markets. v3.1 adds quality filters — erratic rank history, velocity gate, trader count floor, max leverage check — to prevent false IMMEDIATE signals.

📥 **[Download SKILL.md](emerging-movers/SKILL.md)**

---

### Whale Index

Auto-mirror the highest-conviction traders from Senpi's 30-day Discovery leaderboard.

**How it works:** Scans top 50 Discovery traders, scores on PnL rank (35%), win rate (25%), consistency (20%), hold time (10%), drawdown (10%). Creates 2–5 mirror strategies with overlap checks. Daily rebalance with 2-day watch period before swaps.

**Minimum budget:** $500 (recommend $1k+)

## What are Agent Skills?

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) is an open standard for giving AI agents new capabilities. Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that any compatible agent can discover and use. The standard is adopted by Claude, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, VS Code, OpenClaw, and 20+ other platforms.

These skills are built for Senpi on Hyperliquid, but the format is portable — any agent that supports the Agent Skills standard can read and execute them.
