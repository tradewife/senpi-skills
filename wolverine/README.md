# 🦡 WOLVERINE v1.0 — HYPE Alpha Hunter

Part of the [Senpi Trading Skills Zoo](https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills).

## What WOLVERINE Does

WOLVERINE is a single-asset alpha hunter for **HYPE** on Hyperliquid. It uses every available signal source (SM positioning, funding, OI, 4-timeframe trend, volume, BTC correlation) to build a conviction thesis, then trades it with 7-12x leverage and DSL High Water trailing stops.

Based on GRIZZLY v2.0's three-mode lifecycle, adapted for HYPE's volatility profile.

## Three-Mode Lifecycle

```
HUNTING ──> enter ──> RIDING ──> DSL closes ──> STALKING
   ^                    |                          |
   |                    v                          v
   |              thesis breaks              reload OR kill
   |              (reset to HUNT)           (reload=RIDE, kill=HUNT)
   +───────────────────────────────────────────────+
```

- **HUNTING:** Scan every 3 min. Score 10+ across all signals to enter.
- **RIDING:** Position open. DSL trails. Thesis re-evaluated every scan.
- **STALKING:** DSL took profit. Watch for reload on dip, or kill if thesis dies.
